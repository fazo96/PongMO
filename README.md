# PongMO
Multiplayer Online pong web-app using node.js, express and socket.io on the
server side, and Crafty game engine on the client side.

I built this a very small project to learn dynamic web-app developement.

## Usage
Clone this repo then in the root folder run `npm install`, then in the
`client` folder run `bower init`. This makes sure you have all the necessary
client and server dependences installed

Run the app on the server with `node app.js` then point your browser to the
machine's IP address/hostname on port `3000` (by default).

For example, if you want to run it on your *nix / Mac OS machine you can connect
to the local machine by navigating your browser to http://localhost:3000/
